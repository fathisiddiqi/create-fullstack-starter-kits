# Fullstack Starter Kits
This repository contains a collection of fullstack starter kits for building web apps, mobile apps and backend APIs. Each kit is a pre-configured project template that you can use to jumpstart your development process.

## Project Structure

```
├── expo-offline-app/          # Mobile app (mobile) with offline capabilities
└── hono-cloudflare-workers/   # Backend API (backend) with serverless deployment on Cloudflare Workers
```

## Getting Started

### Using templates

To create a new project from a template, use the `create-fullstack-starter-kits` command followed by the project name and the template option. For example:

```bash
npx create-fullstack-starter-kits my-project --template expo-offline
```

This will create a new project named `my-project` using the Expo Offline App template. You can then navigate into the project directory and start development.
