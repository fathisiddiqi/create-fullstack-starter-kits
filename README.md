# Fullstack Starter Kits

Fullstack Starter Kits is a collection of pre-configured project templates for building web apps, mobile apps, and backend APIs. Each kit is a self-contained project with all the necessary dependencies and configurations set up.

## Getting Started

### Using templates

To create a new project from a template, use the `create-fullstack-starter-kits` command followed by the project name and the template option. For example:

```bash
npx create-fullstack-starter-kits my-project --template expo-offline
```

This will create a new project named `my-project` using the Expo Offline App template. You can then navigate into the project directory and start development.

### Available Templates

- `expo-offline`: Mobile app (mobile) with offline capabilities
- `hono-cloudflare-workers`: Backend API (backend) with serverless deployment on Cloudflare Workers
